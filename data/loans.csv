The 19 year old car, which is the car my husband drives to his job at a local university, was just given about a month to live by our mechanic. We've gotten an amazing amount of use out of it but we will need to be sure to get a reliable vehicle before that one gives out. We hope to be able to donate it with some life left in it to a local non-profit. That is what we have done in the past with our old cars.  Our mechanic will help us find a used car in great shape for around $10,000. We have saved about half of that but we really need to make a purchase soon. It would be fabulous to get a loan for a lower percentage rate than what our credit union offers. Currently that is probably about 11% for older vehicles.
